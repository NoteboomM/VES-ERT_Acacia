# Scripts and Notebooks for Electrical methods

I've created this repository to store, manage, and eventually share some Python scripts and notebooks (coming soon) for
testing, modelling & understanding VES and ERT modelling and inversion. Much of the content is taken or adapted from
the [pyGIMLi](https://www.pygimli.org/) project.

Python scripts are in "[scripts"](https://github.com/NoteboomM/VES-ERT_Acacia/tree/master/scripts)". Jupyter notebooks
in "[Notebooks"](https://github.com/NoteboomM/VES-ERT_Acacia/tree/master/notebooks)" while "[exampledata](https://github.com/NoteboomM/VES-ERT_Acacia/tree/master/exampledata)" stores some data files used as inputs and references.
